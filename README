Commands to run the code and see output.

`docker-compose build && docker-compose up`

Note: do to issues getting psql working in my docker image the server spends the first bit of time
populating data into the database. After running the commands listed in set_up_and_run.sh the
docker server image shuts down. If you would like to interact with the cli after the server image
shuts down run `docker start timescale_server_1` to restart the image followed by 
`docker exec -it timescale_server_1 /bin/sh` to interact with the image. `./cli` should run the cli
from inside the image.
